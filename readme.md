#Fantasy5Aside

A simple fantasy football site for those who enjoy keeping track of football without spending hours a week on their teams. This game let the user pick 5 players for their team. The team scores points by the players scoring goals in that game week. The goals are weighted by the position of the scorer.

##Technology Used:
* Html
* Css/Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Python
* Javascript

##Famework Used:
* Django Python Framework

##Technical Challenges:
The main technical issue was to be able to update the team's scoring. To do this I set up a page in which you can downlaod a .csv file with all the players in the database listed. You simply fill in the goals that were scored that week and upload it via the same page. The upload automatically changes the score of each team and switches the leaderboard.

Another challenge was making the website correctly deploy with heroku through GitHub using AWS to house the static material.
