#Fantasy5Aside

###A Simple Fantasy Football Site for those wholike to keep track of football. This games lets the user pick five players for their team. The team scores points by the players scoring goals in that game week. The goals are weighted by the position of the scorer.

##Technology Used
-Html
-Css/Bootstrap
-Jquery
-Python
-Javascript

##Framework Used
-Django Python Framework

##Technical Challenges
The main techniacal issue was to be able to update the team scoring. To do this I set up a page in which you can download a .csv file with all the players on the database listed. You simply fill in the goals that were scored that week and upload it via the same page. The upload automatically changes the score of each team and switches the leaderboard.
Another challenge was making the the website correctly deployed with heroku through GitHub using AWS to house the static material.
